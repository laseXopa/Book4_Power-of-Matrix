Lucky Dube's Trinity is a reggae classic that deserves to be heard by anyone who appreciates good music. It is a testament to his talent, vision, and legacy as a musical icon.
  
Lucky Dube was born on August 3, 1964, in Ermelo, South Africa. He grew up in poverty and experienced the harsh realities of apartheid. He started his musical career as a teenager, singing mbaqanga songs with local bands. He later switched to reggae after being inspired by artists like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. He also became a follower of the Rastafari faith, which influenced his worldview and music.
 
Dube released his first reggae album, Rastas Never Die, in 1984. It was banned by the apartheid government for its political message. He continued to record and perform reggae music despite the censorship and oppression. He gained popularity across Africa and beyond, touring extensively and collaborating with other artists. He also diversified his musical style, incorporating elements of soul, rock, gospel, and pop.
 
Dube was not only a musician but also a humanitarian and activist. He used his music and fame to raise awareness and funds for various causes, such as AIDS prevention, children's rights, and peace. He was also a family man who loved his wife and seven children. He was admired and respected by millions of fans around the world.
 
Tragically, Dube was killed on October 18, 2007, in a carjacking incident in Johannesburg. He was 43 years old. His death shocked and saddened the global music community and his loyal fans. He was mourned as a national hero and a reggae legend. His music lives on as a source of inspiration and hope for many people.
