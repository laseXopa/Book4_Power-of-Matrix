# Darksiders 2 Save Editor: How to Modify Your Game Files
 
Darksiders 2 is a hack-and-slash action-adventure game that lets you play as Death, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The game features a vast open world, a customizable skill system, and a variety of weapons and armor to collect and upgrade. But what if you want to tweak some aspects of your game, such as your level, stats, inventory, or achievements? That's where a save editor comes in handy.
 
A save editor is a tool that allows you to modify your game files and change various parameters of your character and progress. For example, you can increase your health, gold, skill points, or unlock all the items and abilities in the game. You can also edit the game's worlds, scripts, and assets using a save editor.

To use war, you need to locate your save files on your computer. They are usually stored in C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\THQ\Darksiders 2\ or C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Darksiders2\saves\. You can also use other save files from the internet[^2^] [^3^], but make sure they are compatible with your game version and edition. Then, you can either drag and drop your save file into war's online interface[^1^] or run it from the command line with war save decode <path-to-save-file> <output-dir>. This will create a JSON file that contains all the information about your save file.</output-dir></path-to-save-file>
 
Now you can edit the JSON file using any text editor of your choice. You can change any value you want, such as your level, health, gold, skill points, inventory items, achievements, etc. Be careful not to make any invalid changes that might corrupt your save file or cause errors in the game. You can also use war's online interface[^1^] to view and edit some of the values directly.
 
Once you are done editing your JSON file, you need to encode it back into a save file that the game can read. To do this, you can either use war's online interface[^1^] or run it from the command line with war save encode <path-to-json-file> <output-dir>. This will create a new save file that contains your changes. You can then replace your original save file with the new one or rename it accordingly.</output-dir></path-to-json-file>
 
Congratulations! You have successfully edited your Darksiders 2 save file using war. You can now load your game and enjoy your modified character and progress. Have fun!
  
But wait, there's more! war is not only a save editor, but also a tool that lets you view and edit the game's worlds, scripts, and assets. You can use it to explore the game's levels, events, logic, and graphics in detail. You can also modify them to create your own custom scenarios and challenges.
 
To use war for this purpose, you need to locate the game's manifest and resource files on your computer. They are usually stored in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Darksiders or C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Darksiders Warmastered Edition\media\. You can also use other files from the internet, but make sure they are compatible with your game version and edition. Then, you can either use war's online interface or run it from the command line with various options depending on what you want to do.
 
For example, you can use war manifest packages unpack <path-to-darksiders> <output-dir> to extract all the game's assets to a readable format. This will create a folder with thousands of files that contain the game's meshes, textures, audio, etc. You can then view and edit them using any software of your choice. Be careful not to make any invalid changes that might corrupt the files or cause errors in the game.</output-dir></path-to-darksiders>
 
You can also use war worlds decode <path-to-worlds.mnfst> <output-dir> to extract the game's worlds to a JSON format. This will create a folder with hundreds of files that contain the game's levels, maps, objects, triggers, etc. You can then view and edit them using any text editor of your choice. You can also use war worlds visscript draw <path-to-worlds.mnfst> <output-dir> to render the game's visual scripts to Graphviz files. These are graphical representations of the game's logic and events. You can then view and edit them using any Graphviz software of your choice.</output-dir></path-to-worlds.mnfst></output-dir></path-to-worlds.mnfst>
 
You can also use war obsp decode <path-to-scripts.obsp> <output-dir> to extract the game's scripts to a text format. This will create a folder with thousands of files that contain the game's code, functions, variables, etc. You can then view and edit them using any text editor of your choice.</output-dir></path-to-scripts.obsp>
 
However, keep in mind that war cannot re-pack the files into the original format that the game can read. So if you want to use your modified files in the game, you need to find another way to do that. One possible way is to use a mod manager such as Nexus Mod Manager or Vortex that can load custom files into the game without altering the original ones.
 
Wow! You have learned how to use war as a save editor and an asset editor for Darksiders 2. You can now customize your game to your liking and create your own unique experiences. Have fun!
