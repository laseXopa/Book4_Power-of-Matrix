## Step 4: Analyze Your Wi-Fi Network with Heatmaps
 
After you finish collecting Wi-Fi data, you can analyze your network with heatmaps. Heatmaps are color-coded maps that show you various aspects of your Wi-Fi network, such as signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio, channel overlap, download speed, upload speed, etc. You can switch between different heatmaps by clicking on the tabs at the top of the screen. You can also zoom in and out, filter by SSID or frequency band, export or print your heatmaps, and more.
 
## Step 5: Troubleshoot and Optimize Your Wi-Fi Network
 
Based on the heatmaps, you can identify and troubleshoot any issues with your Wi-Fi network. For example, you can find dead zones with low or no signal coverage, locate sources of interference or noise, check for channel conflicts or congestion, test the speed and quality of each access point, etc. You can also use NetSpot Pro's troubleshooting visualizations and professional advice to get recommendations on how to fix any problems. To optimize your Wi-Fi network, you can adjust the placement, configuration, or settings of your access points, change the channels or frequency bands, upgrade your hardware or firmware, etc.
