With the DM Artisan 124 plugin, you can easily subdivide and smooth selected faces, groups, or components, creating smooth and organic shapes. You can also crease edges or vertices to create hard edges, knife subdivide to create loops, extrude to create loops without interior faces, and preview the subsurface geometry before committing. The plugin also has a low-poly proxy mode that automatically updates the subsurface geometry as you edit.
 
Another feature of the DM Artisan 124 plugin is the sculpting brush, which allows you to sculpt, pinch, spread, flatten, inflate, deflate, smooth, and jitter your models. You can also use the select brush to select faces by performing strokes, and the paint brush to paint SketchUp materials on faces using virtual brushstrokes. The plugin also supports symmetrical sculpting mode using a user-defined work plane, and locking vertices to a user-defined work plane.
