Kon-Boot is a tool that allows you to access a locked computer without knowing the user's password. It works by temporarily modifying the system kernel on boot, so that you can log in as any user with a blank password. Kon-Boot supports Windows XP to Windows 11 and OSX 10.6 to macOS Monterey 12. You can also use it to create a new local admin account on Windows or Mac.

To use Kon-Boot, you need to purchase a license from the official website[^1^] and download the .rar file. You will also need a USB drive (<=16GB) or a CD (older version only) to create a bootable media. Here are the steps to use Kon-Boot:
 
1. Extract the .rar file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
2. Run the kon-bootUSB.exe file as administrator and follow the instructions to create a bootable USB drive. Alternatively, you can burn the kon-bootCD.iso file to a CD using a program like ImgBurn or CDBurnerXP.
3. Insert the USB drive or CD into the locked computer and restart it. You may need to change the boot order in the BIOS or UEFI settings to boot from the USB drive or CD.
4. Wait for Kon-Boot to load and press Enter when prompted.
5. Choose the operating system you want to bypass and press Enter.
6. At the login screen, select any user account and leave the password field blank. Press Enter to log in.
7. If you want to create a new local admin account on Windows, press Ctrl+Alt+F10 and follow the instructions. If you want to create a new account on Mac, select New Account Mode from the Kon-Boot menu and follow the instructions.
8. After logging in, you can access the files and programs on the computer as normal. However, remember that Kon-Boot does not permanently change or reset the passwords, so they will be restored after you restart the computer.

Kon-Boot is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can help you bypass Windows or Mac passwords in case you forget them or need to access someone else's computer. However, you should use it responsibly and legally, and respect the privacy of others.
