## What are the main features of Tone2 Electra 2.8.0?
 
Some of the main features of Tone2 Electra 2.8.0 are:

Each layer can have up to 54 oscillators, dual multi-mode filters, a flexible modulation system, effects section and its own arpeggiator[^1^]. You can edit sounds per layer or edit multiple layers simultaneously. You can also save and load separate synthesizer layers from different patches.

You can also edit samples with a wide selection of loop, tune and sample edit options, as well as 12 effects to further process samples[^1^]. You can also use a special quick import sample and quick vocoder menu option to set up a sample or vocoder patch easily.
- **Oscillators and synthesis types:** Tone2 Electra 2.8.0 offers a selection of 14 different types of synthesis, ranging from traditional ones like virtual analog, wavetable, subtractive, phase distortion and FM synthesis, to more exotic ones like physical modeling, ultra-saw, vocoder, sync, ringmod, PWM, noise, wave-shaping and Tone2's exclusive fractal synthesis[^1^]. Each synthesis type was designed with attention to sound quality, musical potential and low CPU usage.
