# Borderlands 2: Ultimate Vault Hunters Upgrade Pack Review
 
Borderlands 2: Ultimate Vault Hunters Upgrade Pack is a downloadable content (DLC) pack for the popular first-person shooter game Borderlands 2. It was released on April 2nd, 2013 and costs $4.99 or 400 Microsoft Points. The pack is free for Season Pass holders, who can access all four DLC packs for Borderlands 2.

It adds a new layer of difficulty and excitement to the game, as well as more customization options for the characters.
