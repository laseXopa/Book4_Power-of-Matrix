His Ave Maria was written in 1970 for mezzo-soprano solo and piano accompaniment. It is a simple but elegant piece that expresses the devotion and reverence of the prayer. The melody is lyrical and expressive, with a gentle rise and fall that creates a sense of longing and peace. The piano part supports the voice with rich harmonies and subtle modulations that enhance the mood of the piece.
 
The lyrics of Ave Maria are in Latin, and they are based on the words of the angel Gabriel to Mary at the Annunciation (Luke 1:28) and of Elizabeth to Mary at the Visitation (Luke 1:42). The prayer praises Mary as the mother of Jesus and asks for her intercession for sinners.
