## What is Pachipara 14?
 
Pachipara 14 is a pachinko simulator developed and published by Irem solely for Japan on the PS2. It was released on July 26, 2007, and it is the final game in the series released for that platform[^2^]. Pachipara 14 simulates two Sanyo-produced pachinko machines in their Umi Monogatari line: the CR Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa MTA and the CR Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa SAD. The changes from the machines featured in the previous game, Pachipara 13, are predominantly aesthetic in nature[^2^].
 
Pachipara 14 features faithful 3D recreations of the pachinko machines, with realistic physics, sound effects, and animations. You can adjust various settings, such as the ball speed, volume, and zoom level. You can also view detailed statistics of your play history, such as the number of balls played, won, and lost, the number of jackpots triggered, and the payout ratio. You can also save your progress and resume it later[^3^].
 
## How to play Pachipara 14?
 
Pachipara 14 is easy to play, even if you are not familiar with pachinko. The game has a tutorial mode that explains the basic rules and features of pachinko. You can also access a help menu at any time during gameplay. The game controls are simple: you use the analog stick to adjust the knob that controls the ball launcher, and you press the X button to launch the balls. You can also use the L1 and R1 buttons to tilt the machine slightly left or right, which can affect the ball trajectory[^3^].
 
The goal of pachinko is to launch balls into the machine and try to get them into special pockets that trigger jackpots. Jackpots are sequences of events that reward you with more balls. The more balls you have, the more chances you have to win more jackpots. The Umi Monogatari machines have various types of jackpots, such as normal mode, chance mode, super chance mode, fever mode, super fever mode, and big bang mode. Each mode has different probabilities and payouts. The machines also have various bonus features, such as mini-games, animations, and songs[^2^].
 
## What else does Pachipara 14 offer?
 
Besides the pachinko simulation mode, Pachipara 14 also offers a completely separate open world RPG mode by the name of PachiPro FÃ…Â«unroku 6. This is the third and last incarnation of the PachiPro FÃ…Â«unroku subseries as an open world RPG before it would transition into the visual novel genre upon its revival in the PachiPara series' 3DS entries[^2^].
 
In PachiPro FÃ…Â«unroku 6 mode, you play as a customizable protagonist who is a pachinko pro. The story begins with a pachinko match gone awry, with you thrown off a ship after being accused of rigging the match. You wake up on a riverbank back on your
