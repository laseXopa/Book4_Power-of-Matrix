The 3D version of Titanic was released in 2012 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ship's voyage. Cameron and his team spent more than a year converting the original film into 3D, using advanced technology and meticulous attention to detail. The result is a stunning visual experience that enhances the emotional impact and realism of the film.
 
Titanic 3D received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised the film's story, performances, music, cinematography and 3D effects. The film also earned more than $340 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing re-releases of all time. Titanic 3D is a must-see for fans of the original film and for anyone who wants to witness the beauty and tragedy of the Titanic in a new dimension.

One of the most challenging aspects of making Titanic 3D was the conversion process itself. Cameron and his team had to scan every frame of the original film and create a second eye view for each one, using sophisticated software and manual adjustments. The process took about 60 weeks and cost $18 million, but Cameron insisted that it was worth it to give the film a new life and a new audience.
 
Another challenge was to preserve the authenticity and accuracy of the film's historical details. Cameron is known for his meticulous research and attention to detail, and he wanted to make sure that Titanic 3D did not compromise on any of the facts or visuals that he had painstakingly recreated for the original film. He also made some minor corrections and enhancements to the film, such as fixing some continuity errors and improving some of the digital effects.
 
Titanic 3D also gave the cast and crew an opportunity to revisit their memories and experiences of making the film. Many of them expressed their admiration and gratitude for Cameron's vision and leadership, as well as their fondness and respect for their co-stars. They also shared some of the challenges and joys of working on such a massive and ambitious project, such as the long hours, the cold water, the physical demands, and the emotional impact.

Titanic 3D was not only a technical achievement, but also a commercial success. The film grossed more than $340 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing re-releases of all time. The film also surpassed the $2 billion mark in its lifetime gross, becoming the second film in history to do so after Cameron's own Avatar. Titanic 3D proved that there was still a huge demand and appreciation for the film, even 15 years after its original release.
 
Titanic 3D also received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised the film's story, performances, music, cinematography and 3D effects. The film has a 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\" The film also has an 8/10 score on IMDb, based on over 1.1 million user ratings.
