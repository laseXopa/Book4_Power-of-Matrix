## What is CES EduPack 2013?
 
CES EduPack 2013 is a unique set of teaching resources that includes a database of materials and process information, materials selection tools and a range of supporting textbooks, lectures, projects and exercises[^1^]. It is designed to support materials education across various subject areas and levels, from pre-university to postgraduate courses. CES EduPack 2013 has three levels of databases and tools that correspond to different stages of learning:
 
- Level 1: Introductory level for pre-university and first-year undergraduate students. It covers the basics of materials science and engineering, design and sustainability. It has data on about 100 materials and 60 processes.
- Level 2: Intermediate level for second- and third-year undergraduate students. It covers more advanced topics such as materials selection, eco-design, bioengineering and medical devices. It has data on about 3000 materials and 200 processes.
- Level 3: Advanced level for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students. It covers specialized topics such as aerospace, automotive, polymers, composites and ceramics. It has data on about 4000 materials and 250 processes.

CES EduPack 2013 also supports leading materials textbooks such as Ashby et al., Callister, Shackelford and Askeland[^1^]. It uses the Ashby materials selection methodology to help students choose the best materials for their design problems[^1^].
 
## How to Use CES EduPack 2013?
 
To use CES EduPack 2013, you need to install it on your computer or access it online through your institution's license. You can download a free trial version from the Ansys Granta website[^1^]. Once you launch the software, you will see a new visual, interactive start-up screen that helps you choose the relevant database and tool for your task[^2^]. You can also use the search function to find specific materials or properties[^2^].
 
The main features of CES EduPack 2013 are:

- Browse: You can browse the database like an interactive textbook, with images, graphs, tables and explanations of materials and processes. You can also compare different materials or processes on various criteria such as cost, performance or environmental impact.
- Select: You can use the materials selection tools to find the best materials for your design problem. You can define your objectives, constraints and functions, and then plot them on charts or tables. You can also use the Eco Audit tool to estimate the environmental impact of your product lifecycle.
- Synthesize: You can use the synthesizer tool to create new materials or processes by combining existing ones. You can also add models or equations to calculate properties or performance of your new materials or processes.
- Teach: You can use the teaching resources to enhance your learning or teaching experience. You can access interactive projects, exercises and lectures that cover various topics related to materials education. You can also customize your own teaching materials using the software.
