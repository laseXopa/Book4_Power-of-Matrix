The game is inspired by classic 16-bit era sidescrollers and focuses on fast-paced action combined with modern physics and animation. The game allows players to interact with the environment and use it to their advantage. For example, players can ride on vehicles, swing on ropes, or throw objects at enemies. The game also has a unique art style with hand-drawn graphics and animation.
 
Intrusion 2 has 14 levels, each with its own unique environments, enemies, and bosses. The game also features a local co-op mode, allowing players to team up and play through the game together. The game has three difficulty modes, with more enemies and dangers in hard mode. The game also supports full-screen mode for a better gaming experience.
