> "Very good auto-arrangement software. Does everything the hardware arrangers are capable of. Styles for many keyboards can be imported."[^3^]

> "The best part of the vArranger 2 that caught my attention is the midi maps and sequencing. They are very fluid and easy on the eye. The sequencing is very âtightâ and accurate. I have seen other versions of vArranger but this is the only one that I currently have installed on my system."[^1^]
