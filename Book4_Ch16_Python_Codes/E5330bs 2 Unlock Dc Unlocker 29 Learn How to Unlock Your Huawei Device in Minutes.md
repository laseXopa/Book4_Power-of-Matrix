# How to Unlock Huawei E5330Bs-2 Router Using DC-Unlocker
 
Huawei E5330Bs-2 is a mobile Wi-Fi router that allows you to connect up to 10 devices to the internet. It is locked to a specific network provider and requires a SIM card from that provider to work. However, if you want to use a different SIM card from another network, you need to unlock your router first.
 
One of the easiest and fastest ways to unlock Huawei E5330Bs-2 router is using DC-Unlocker software. DC-Unlocker is a program that can detect and unlock various modems and routers from different manufacturers. It supports many models of Huawei routers, including E5330Bs-2.

## What You Need

- If DC-Unlocker cannot detect your router or gives an error connecting to the server, check your adapter bindings settings and make sure they are correct.
- If your router has a blocked counter (unlock attempts left : 0), you cannot unlock it using DC-Unlocker. You may try to flash it to a different firmware version (such as 21.210.21.00.00) and then try again, but there is no guarantee that it will work.
- If you have any questions or need further assistance, you can contact DC-Unlocker support team via their forum ([here](https://forum.dc-unlocker.com/forum/modems-and-phones/huawei)) or email ([support@dc 8cf37b1e13
